Building a personal portfolio site based off Technigo's figma design.

Still a work in progress due to fixing some issues with the link icons not properly displaying. Exporting directly from the figma file gave me very ugly graphics so I ended up going the font-awesome icon route and using border-radius to get the right look. 

I love my cover image from unsplash. It's perfect.

I am unsure of the Featured Projects section... the styling is feeling very... chunky. I'm wondering if there's a cleaner way to go about it or if I'm over styling where I don't need to.

I'm still not very sure about the accessibility testing, the biggest thing I underestimated was time management on this. I didn't think it would take as long but with the testing thrown in... well... now I know better.
